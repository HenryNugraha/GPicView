	* src/main-win.c:
		- made gpicview to open in fullscreen mode.
		- increase zoom step size.

		- always fit image to windows size when switching from fullscreen to unfullscreen.

	* src/image-list.c:
		- implemented Gregory Smith's Numacomp (numerically aware string comparison)
		  when building image list.
		- disable wrapping around image in list..
